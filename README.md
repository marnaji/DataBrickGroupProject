# DataBrickGroupProject
## Background 
In our collaborative project, we conducted data analysis utilizing a database associated with an imaginary company known as Northwind. The process involved the following steps:

1. Importing data from various sources.
2. Examining and interpreting the data.
3. Creating visual representations of the data.
4. Communicating the insights derived from the data.
All queries were executed using SQL, and PySpark was not utilized for this purpose.
